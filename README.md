Morse Code Simulator is a teaching tool for learning Morse that I initially created on a whim. Two years later, 
I went back and [updated it to fix long-standing issues](https://popcar2.itch.io/morse-code-simulator/devlog/900804/version-20-is-now-out) and decided to open-source it. 
Most of the code was written when I was new to Godot, so the project is uncommented & a bit unorganized. Anyway, have fun!

* Morse Typing Speed adjusts how quickly you need to press the button before it expects the next letter/word.
